This is a simple statistics calculator application when prompted the user can input numbers numbers within the JTextField
the numbers are then added to an array where they are converted into integers. The numbers are then calculated displaying 
Mean, Median , and Mode. The sum of the numbers is displayed within the JTextArea. Within the swing components there is a JButton
, when pressed it also displays the Standard Deviation and Variance (Standard Deviation).

##Known Issues
The issues comprise of the decimal computation to be slightly off
The other is currently the application only finds one Mode. If other numbers are inputted that are the same it only recognizes 
one of those Modes.
